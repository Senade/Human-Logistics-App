Human Logistics

Never in the history of the humankind have we been more interconnected than we are today. Information and ideas flow freely from state to state, nation to nation and continent to continent. In a world like ours, it almost seems unreasonable that transporting a book across national borders should cost so much more and take so much longer than transferring a .pdf file across the same borders would. Connecting people has always resulted in the most significant contributions to the development of modern society and as it stands now, the inefficient and inconvenient methods of transporting goods across long distances are one of the greatest barriers to absolute modernization. We at Human Logistics strive to break down these barriers. 

We realized that every day, thousands of people were travelling from city to city, across the world on various airlines. These are the same routes that international shipments take. It’s reasonable to assume that many of these international travelers have, if only a little, unutilized baggage space that they wouldn’t mind filling up with a package that ensures they would still satisfy check-in baggage weight restrictions. Human Logistics works to match the individual or company requesting a delivery with a transporter that fits the departure and arrival city specifications.

It is important to note that the Human Logistics App was designed to make it convenient for both transporter and the person requesting the delivery to understand their roles in the delivery process. The app is but a structure that supports the much broader startup idea. 

At full implementation, an example run would be as follows: person ‘A’ in Bangalore fills and submits the ‘Request a Delivery’ form on the app.  The cost of delivery will be priced based on the weight of the package and the distance from destination address. When we identify a willing user (Person ‘B’) travelling in the required route, we will collect the package in Bangalore and temporarily store it at our counter in the airport where it will undergo a thorough scan by airport security personnel. Person ‘B’ has specified that he would not mind carrying a package of a specific weight to the delivery location. He will collect the package (which, by now, will have a baggage-tracking device provided by us) at the Human Logistics counter and accept that he is responsible for the safety of the package before checking in his baggage and after recollecting it. At the end of his journey, he will proceed to drop off the package at another counter by scanning the Human Logistics label and will choose how he’d like to receive his payment. Human Logistics staff will retrieve the baggage-tracking device and the package will be delivered to the destination address.

Our idea allows for the transportation of small shipments across large distances for marginal prices in relatively less time. The traveler benefits both by utilizing what would otherwise be wasted baggage real estate and earning money for his generosity. The person requesting the delivery benefits not only from the lowered costs and shipment time, but also from the personal nature of the whole interaction.
