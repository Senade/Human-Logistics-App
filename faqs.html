  <p>what do i do if i want a package delivered?  </p>
  </div>
  <p>fill out the 'request a delivery' page with your address details, the weight of the package you'd like delivered and when you'd like us to come pick up the package. we will match you up with a traveller potentially willing to carry your package and take care of the rest!  </p>
  <div id="questions">
  <p>what do i do if i would like to carry a package?</p>
  </div>
  <p>fill out the 'deliver a package' page with your departure and arrival details and how much weight you wouldn't mind carrying. leave the rest to us and we will get in touch with more details in absolutely no time.</p>
  <div id="questions">
  <p>how is this priced?</p>
  </div>
  <p>the price is determined based on the weight of the package, the distance it will travel and the duration of the flight.</p>
  <div id="questions">
  <p>what kind of goods can i not send?</p>
  </div>
  <p>consumables such as food and drink, narcotic drugs, firearms, alcohol, goods valued higher than the delivery country's customs restrictions and items that are regularly banned by airline companies (see your airline company's website) are strictly prohibited . the package will undergo strict airport screening procedures before being handed over to the traveller. </p>
  <div id="questions">
  <p>how long will it take to get my package delivered?</p>
  </div>
  <p>this depends on how busy the selected route is. it should normally take no longer than 3-4 days to find a traveller willing to transport your package. </p>
  <div id="questions">
  <p>who is responsible if my package gets lost or stolen?</p>
  </div>
  <p>your package can will be tracked throughout the plane journey by our baggage locator devices (we will add these to every package you ask us to deliver - they will be dropped off at our counter in the destination airport). before and after the baggage is checked into the airplane, the traveller will be responsible for any lost, stolen or damaged goods. if there is significant proof that the package was damaged due to unavoidable circumstances brought upon by the flight, we will set up correspondance between the owner of the package and the airline company. </p>
  <p>to ensure your package gets to its destination safe and sound is our topmost priority.</p>
